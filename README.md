# Terminal-shop for VS Code

**Terminal-shop** is the *very unofficial* VS Code extension that lets you order coffee from [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop) — because switching to your terminal is, like, soooo 2023.

Crafted in Neovim, debugged in VS Code, and sprinkled with love <3

## ☕ Getting Started

1. Run this in your terminal to generate a shiny new token:

    ```bash
    ssh terminal.shop -t tokens
    ```

2. Copy that token like your productivity depends on it (because it does), then paste it into the dialog box that pops up when you launch the extension from the activity bar.

NOTE: For more details on how to get your token, check out the [terminal.shop docs](https://www.terminal.shop/api#authentication).

3. Once you've got your token, you can start by adding a Shipping address and Payment methods by navigating through the Tree View.

4. After that, you can add products to your cart and place orders.

## ❓ First Time Here?

The mad geniuses behind [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop) built an entire SSH-based coffee shop. Yes. SSH. Because who needs modern web protocols when you’ve got ANSI escape codes?

Unfortunately, their brilliant backend-only approach made it virtually impenetrable to anyone who’s ever used a color picker unironically.

That’s where this extension comes in — now *you*, dear WebDev or Vibe Coder™, can order artisanal espresso without ever leaving your safe space (aka VS Code/Cursor).
